## NSEMBED Mini Project 1 - Sleep Monitoring System
<div align="justify">

This project showcases a Sleep Monitoring System using a PIR sensor, an ESP32, and a computer to track and record a subjectâ€™s sleep activity. It logs events with timestamps, including movement and idle periods, and calculates statistics such as total, average, median, mode, maximum, and minimum durations for both movement and idle times. The system was tested through real sleeping scenarios, with results analyzed to understand sleep patterns.

A Python script processes the raw data from the ESP32, logs sleep movements and idle periods, calculates statistics, and exports the results to CSV and Excel files.
